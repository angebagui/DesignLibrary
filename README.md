Samples for Android Design Support Library

#Design Support Library
Android 5.0 Lollipop was one of the most significant Android releases ever, in no small part due to the introduction of material design, a new design language that refreshed the entire Android experience. Google detailed spec is a great place to start to adopt material design, but Google understood that it can be a challenge for developers, particularly ones concerned with backward compatibility. With a little help from the new Android Design Support Library,they’re bringing a number of important material design components to all developers and to all Android 2.1 or higher devices. You’ll find a navigation drawer view, floating labels for editing text, a floating action button, snackbar, tabs, and a motion and scroll framework to tie them together.
